Bowling game
============

I decided to implement the famous bowling game kata in ruby with rspec. I had to practice rspec structure and plain ruby.
What would be better to start with than the game that TDD famous for?

Closer, but not close enough
----------------------------

I went on by myself, testcase by testcase. A few testcase may be skipped, but I left them there, because they led me to the code I have now.
Then I reread the Uncle Bob version and realizes that my code is very far from that coherent, elegant and small solution.
So I try to improve this codepiece to have a much clearer and more readable code.
